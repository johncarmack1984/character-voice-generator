# character-voice-generator.py

Sometimes, when doing audiobook auditions, I become creatively exhausted with the same old voices I've been doing. "Old man," "young boy," "generic woman." What if I could flex my instrument, without breaking the creative bank? That's where Character Voice Generator comes in..

Download the repo, cd into the folder, open a terminal, then type:

```
python character-voice-generator.py
```

or
```
python3 character-voice-generator.py
```

as the case may be.

Enjoy!
