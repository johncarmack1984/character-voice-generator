# character-voice-generator.py

Sometimes, when doing audiobook auditions, I become creatively exhausted with the same old voices I've been doing. "Old man," "young boy," "generic woman." What if I could flex my instrument, without breaking the creative bank? That's where Character Voice Generator comes in..

Download the repo, cd into the folder, open a terminal, then type:

```
python character-voice-generator.py
```

or
```
python3 character-voice-generator.py
```

as the case may be.

Enjoy!

Some sample voices:

>    Bark Phoenix's voice has a Laban Effort of Flicking (Sudden, indirect & light). She is a Woman who places her voice in her Throat (Kermit the Frog style). She is Old, and the air in her voice has a Dry quality. 
>    
>    Her voice is Medium in size, and she speaks at a Medium tempo with a Quiet volume. Her attitude is Agressive, and her Welsh accent can be heard in everything she says. 
>    
>    Bark Phoenix's vocal issue is None.
