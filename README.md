# character-voice-generator

Sometimes, when doing audiobook auditions, I become creatively exhausted with the same old voices I've been doing. "Old man," "young boy," "generic woman." What if I could flex my instrument, without breaking the creative bank? That's where Character Voice Generator comes in.

Enjoy!
